            <h2>Application Analyst</h2>
            <h3>2019-2021</h3>
            <p>
            As an Application Analyst, I was responsible for maintaining and updating 
            demographic information for both internal and external healthcare providers, 
            which is crucial for medical and outreach activities across the organization.  
            I manage the Netpresenter application and its servers, overseeing all screensaver 
            and digital signage requirements for our six delivery networks, including remote offices. 
            My role involved collaborating with a diverse group of users, up to director level, 
            to design and implement SharePoint sites and webpages that cater to different departmental 
            needs like team collaboration and data analysis.

            <h2>Senior Service Desk Analyst</h2>
            <h3>2016-2019</h3>
            <p>
            During my tenure as a Senior Service Desk Analyst at YNHH, I provided 
            First and Second Tier support to approximately 30,000 users, including 
            vendors and medical community practices. My responsibilities included 
            ensuring that Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for incident tickets and 
            service requests were met promptly. I troubleshooted issues both on-site 
            and remotely using tools like Bomgar, Remote Desktop Connection, and 
            SCCM. On an average day, I managed 40-50 calls.  I was also in charge 
            of the Service Desk mailbox, which received over 200 emails daily, converting 
            these into actionable tickets and service requests as needed. I played a 
            crucial role in the Critical Incident Response Team, addressing high-severity 
            issues like network outages or unexpected application downtimes. My tasks 
            extended to managing user permissions in Active Directory, updating 
            Organizational Units (OUs) for effective group policy application. Additionally, 
            I structured and conducted training sessions for new employees on various workflows, 
            Epic modules, and ticket assignment processes, all while adhering strictly to HIPAA 
            guidelines concerning Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personal Identifiable 
            Information (PII).

            <h1>RICOH</h1>
            <h3>2014-2016</h3>
            <p>
            From October 2014 to March 2016, I served as a Copier Repair Technician 
            for Ricoh, managing the Northern Westchester territory. My responsibilities 
            included servicing Multi-Function Printers, scanners, and faxes across both 
            private and public sectors, working in diverse settings ranging from factories 
            and small offices/home offices to major business headquarters. As the Lead Technician, 
            I spearheaded a significant installation project at MasterCard International 
            Headquarters in Purchase, NY, managing the setup of over 80 Multi-Function 
            Printers. I utilized technical manuals to diagnose and resolve both mechanical 
            and electrical issues with Ricoh products. My routine duties also involved 
            rebuilding and replacing printer components, upgrading PCB boards, and 
            handling expansion cards for networking and interfacing enhancements.
